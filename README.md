## AudioCube

This version of PhotoCube is named AudioCube and implemented to support explortaion in a music collection.
It contains three new components: a SpotifyWidget to play audio, a Slider to range filter a numerical tagset and a ColorToggle that renders the browsing state with color. The used color scale is logaritmic based on track densisty in cubes.
